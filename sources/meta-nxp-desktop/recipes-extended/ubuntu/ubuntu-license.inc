# This LICENSE entry really needs to be fixed. Desktop passes through
# open source software and we have an aggregated set of open source
# licenses that is hard to characterize. If anyone can suggest a proper
# way to fix this, please do so! The MIT related entry is borrowed
# from the merge-files recipe to show intent of passing through
# files from other origins in a proper fashion.
